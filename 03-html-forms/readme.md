## HTML Forms 
- We can create a form using HTML.
- we need <form> tag when we are creating a form in HTML.
<input>- to take input from user
#### Different Attributes
1. Here we also have to describe the type of input, we use **type** attribute for it.
2. **id** attribute is used to identify any tag, value of id attribute should be unique and no other element on same page can have same value.
3. **name** attribute is used for submitting a form element to the server
4. **required** attribute is used when it's necessary to get input from user in a particular field.
5. **placeholder** is used to write any temporary text in any field and it vanishes away as soon as user starts typing in that particular field.
