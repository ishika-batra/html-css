## What is CSS Grid?

- CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives us to easily align items and create two-dimensional layout.
- It works in the principle of rows and columns.
- Flexbox and CSS grid are very similar.
- Flexbox was created first, it has a bit more browser compatibility but CSS Grid also works in all modern day browsers. 
- We can use both according to our preference, ex: Use grid for the overall layout of website(laying out headers and cards) and if there are inner elements that need to be aligned there we can use flexbox.
