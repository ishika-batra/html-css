## INTRODUCTION
This repository serves as a comprehensive starting point, offering a collection of files and code snippets that cover the essential aspects of HTML and CSS. It is designed to be accessible to developers of all skill levels, providing a gentle learning curve for those who are new to web development.


The course I followed is called [HTML & CSS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G) and it's created by The Net Ninja.

For more info about a specific topic, navigate to that topic's directory and check out the readme file for the notes.
