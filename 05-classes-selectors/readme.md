## Classes and Selectors
#### Class

- Class is an attribute in HTML that provide  us a hook for CSS and we can use it as a selector so that we can style just that element.

#### Id
- Same as a class id can also be for hooks in CSS but it's most commonly used for javascript.
- One constraint of ID is that you can only use one ID of this name on each page

#### Descendant Selectors
- Can be used to style nested elements.

#### Attribute Selectors
- Different attributes can be used to style elements in CSS.

#### Cascade
- Cascade is about CSS properties flowing down from parents to children.
- It encompasses two different concepts inheritance and specificity.

**Note:Precedence in style sheet works from top to bottom,so whatever is declared last that takes precedence. The one that is further down is applied. But if specificity of a selector is more precedence is given to that selector.**
